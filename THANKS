This file contains a mostly order-less list of people I have to thank for
help out with the Sendpage project.  When I can remember what they did in
particular, I've noted it.


Jerry Paul Taft
	Born Israel Kotchka 8/10/45 in Russia
	Died 6/21/00 in Chicago

	He was a camper and counselor for many years at Camp Chi in
	Wisconsin.  He was offered a graduate fellowship in philosophy
	at Stanford University. He opposed the war in Vietnam.  He was
	a co-founder of the Revolutionary Automobile Cooperative in
	Chicago and worked as a mechanic there.  He drove a cab.  He
	lived and worked on Kibbutz Be'eri in Israel. He struggled for
	almost 30 years with manic-depressive illness, struggling also
	to remain as independent as possible.  He loved coffee and
	cigarettes.  He helped care for his parents when they became
	ill.  He was a faithful friend.  He remained opposed to
	injustice and nonsense his entire life, never lost his ideals,
	and lived his life with integrity and without pretension.  He
	will be missed.

	Found a bug where modem settings were not being passed through
	correctly (PC default were set instead).


Philip Moors
	<PMoors@edisonmission.com>
	Found a bug in the Modem disconnect function.  I wasn't actually
	letting go of the modem on a chat failure.

	Found a setgid taint bug in Modem.pm for me.

	if I didn't use any of the code (AppConfig).


Eric Schenk
	<Eric.Schenk@dna.lth.se>
	for giving me a clear example of how to create a uucp-style lock file
	for a serial device.   (And for teaching me about "kill(0, pid)"!)

	for a huge list of PC information.


Kurt Boyack

	use sendpage.

	for endless support and encouragement.
