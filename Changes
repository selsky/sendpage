0.9.5:
	- move kicker section of "chat" in Modem.pm to the front,
	  so kickers won't be sent during the last timeout cycle.
	- created an "answerretries" variable for the Paging Central
	  to match "answerwait" for some slow Paging Centrals.

0.9.4c: (07/28/2000, argh: deadly typo.  I should be more careful)
	- fixed a stupid typo in Modem.pm

0.9.4b: (07/28/2000, another point-release due to serious bug fixes)
	- made sendpage fail with exit codes on bad pager aliases
	- smooshed setgid taint removed in Modem.pm
	- smooshed modem disconnect chat failure buf in Modem.pm
	- queue manager announces it's version (for people sending debugging)

0.9.4a: (07/13/2000, point-release due to serious numeric-only paging bug)
	- created the "lfok" option and corrected the ctrl-char detection
          code.  This bug made paging numeric pagers impossible because of
	  the trailing LF.
	- fixed some typos in the documentation

0.9.4: (06/30/2000)
	- email notification completed
	- error reporting cleaned up further
	- temporary failures will eventually time out
	- added a bunch of documentation
	- converted all the package names to be correct
	- fixed a bug with alias expansion across multiple PCs
	- changed how we listen for children (now a wait loop, not SIGCHLD)
	- fixed up modem ioctl checking
	- allowed any PIN@PC as recipient if the PC exists
	- fixed the stupid damn error I've ever seen with Perl.  The
	  ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn't let you have imbedded PODs inside
          .pm files that have "config" or "setup" in their name.  STUPID!
          I had to change KeesConfig to KeesConf.  I guess it has a nicer
          ring to it, but that's just plain dumb.

0.9.3: (06/21/2000)
	- created the logging subsystem and migrated to it
	- working more issues out of the TAP implementation
	- more and more error checking
	- started the framework for email support
	- created Makefile.PL and started adding pod documentation

0.9.2: (06/17/2000)
	- queue manager fully implemented and tested.  should be stable.
	- debugging cleaned up: one line at a time, prep'ing for syslog.
	- continued misc bug fixes.

0.9.1: (06/14/2000)
	- queue manager written and mostly functioning.
	- Device::Serial buffer-flushing bug worked around.
	- various improvements and bug fixes to TAP implementation.
	- various improvements to config engine.
	- tested with 2 more PCs.  Seems totally fine.

0.9.0: (04/27/2000)
	- initial public release.
	- TAP protocol implemented and tested.
	- configuration engine implemented and tested.
	- I registered a Sourceforge account.
	- Code is FAR from finished, but it at least controls the modem
	  correctly (one hard part), has a configuration engine (another
	  hard part), and speaks TAP within most specs that I can find.
	  And I've tested it with a whole *2* paging centrals.  :)
