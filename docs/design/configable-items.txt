How the PC acts:

max baud, parity/bits/stop
incomplete responses (answers don't start with a CR)
does not allow chars < 0x20
does not handle escaped chars < 0x20  (can send everything but cr?)

max # blocks per call
max # pages per call
max chars per block
max chars per page

can handle field splits

timeout to answer
