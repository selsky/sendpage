Postfix to Sendpage Email Configuration, from Randy Emler with additions
by Chris Hubbell and Russell L. Adams:


The virtual domain (e.g. "paging.example.com") should already be in DNS, with
the sendpage server setup in MX record.

Modify the /etc/postfix/transport file to include:

	paging.example.com		sendpage:localhost

Modify the /etc/postfix/master.cf file to include:

	sendpage     unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe flags=
        user=nobody argv=/usr/bin/sendmail2snpp -f $(sender) $(user)
	
	Just make sure the "argv=" points to the proper path for the agent.

In /etc/postfix/main.cf, add virtual domain to the "mydestination" line:

mydestination = myhost.example.com, myhost, localhost.localdomain, localhost, paging.example.com

In /etc/postfix/main.cf, turn on transport maps:

	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

In /etc/postfix/main.cf, uncomment "local_recipient_maps":
	local_recipient_maps =

From "/etc/postfix", run "postmap transport" to create the transport.db file.

Make sure your paging box accepts smtp connections from your corporate mail
gateway box.

Restart postfix.

Make sure recipients are setup in the sendpage.cf file like the following
	[recip:joe_blow]
	dest = 5551212@mypagingqueue
		
Try sending an email page addressed like the following

	To:joe_blow@paging.example.com
	Subject: Test Page
	
	Hello, I am a test page thru email using sendpage.
