Postfix to Sendpage Email Configuration, from Randy Emler:


Modify the /etc/postfix/transport file to include
	<your paging hostname>		sendpage:localhost
	
	Example:
	spage.yourdomain.com      sendpage:localhost

Modify the /etc/postfix/master.cf file to include	
	sendpage     unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
	    flags= user=nobody argv=/usr/bin/sendmail2snpp -f $(user) $(sender)
	
	Just make sure the "argv=" points to the proper path for the agent.

Modify the /etc/postfix/main.cf file to include
	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

Run: "postmap transport" to create the transport.db file

Make sure your paging box accepts smtp connections from your corporate mail
gateway box.

Run: "service postfix stop", "service postfix start"

Make sure recipients are setup in the sendpage.cf file like the following
	[recip:joe_blow]
	dest = 5551212@mypagingqueue
		
Try sending an email page addressed like the following

	To:joe_blow@spage.yourdomain.com
	Subject: Test Page
	
	Hello, I am a test page thru email using sendpage.
