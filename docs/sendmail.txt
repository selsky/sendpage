Just to note, this documentation assumes you're using sendmail version 8.8.x
or better.


To get sendpage working with sendmail, there are a few things you'll need:

	1) set up sendpage (and test)
	2) get yourself a paging domain
	3) configure sendmail to use your domain
	4) configure email2page.conf
	5) test your set up
	6) add stuff to your sendmail.cf file


Step 1: Set up sendpage (and test)
----------------------------------

	Assuming you've already configured sendpage, and tested it with
"snpp", and you've gotten your page, you're ready to move on to step 2.


Step 2: Get yourself a paging domain
------------------------------------

	Since I get most of my email from "outflux.net", I decided I'd
make my paging domain "pager.outflux.net".  So I added this to my DNS
information, and refreshed my DNS server.  Once you have a domain resolving
with your DNS server, continue to step 3.


Step 3: Configure sendmail to use your domain
---------------------------------------------

	Add your domain to either the "Cw" line in sendpage, or add it
to the /etc/sendmail.cw file (recommended).  Restart sendmail, and
continue to step 4.


Step 4: Configure email2page.conf
---------------------------------

	Take a look at /etc/email2page.conf and set up the header rules
to suite your needs.  The file is fairly well documented.  When finished,
continue to step 5.


Step 5: Test your set up
------------------------

	Send a page by piping an email (with headers) into "sendmail2snpp".
This tool should run "email2page" and "snpp" for you.  Once you get it 
working, continue to step 6.


Step 6: Add stuff to your sendmail.cf file
------------------------------------------

	I recommend using style a), but you can choose either:

	a) add stuff to your sendmail.mc file (and regenerate your sendmail.cf
	   file).  Change "pager.outflux.net" and the sendmail2snpp path, if
	   you need to:

		dnl
		dnl Kees' changes for sendpage
		dnl
		# for pager gateway
		CGpager.outflux.net
		LOCAL_RULE_0
		# sendpage
		R$+<@$=G.>	$#sendpage $:$1
		define(`SENDPAGE_MAILER_PATH',`/usr/local/bin/sendmail2snpp')
		define(`SENDPAGE_MAILER_FLAGS',`lsPn')
		define(`SENDPAGE_MAILER_ARGS',`sendmail2snpp -f $f')
		MAILER_DEFINITIONS
		Msendpage, P=SENDPAGE_MAILER_PATH, F=SENDPAGE_MAILER_FLAGS,
			S=10, R=20, A=SENDPAGE_MAILER_ARGS $u

	-or-

	b) add stuff to your sendmail.cf file directly.  Change
	   "pager.outflux.net" and the sendmail2snpp path, if you need
	   to.

		Near the top:

			# for pager gateway
			CGpager.outflux.net

		At the end of rule "S98":

			# sendpage
			R$+<@$=G.>	$#sendpage $:$1

		Near your mailer definitions:

			Msendpage, P=/usr/local/bin/sendmail2snpp, F=lsPn,
				S=10, R=20, A=sendmail2snpp -f $f $u



Once that's done, restart sendmail with your new .cf file, and you should
be ready to rock and roll.


Troubleshooting
---------------
On RedHat systems, or machines using "smrsh", try this:

	Here is how to get smrsh to work:
	cd /etc/smrsh
	ln -s /usr/bin/sendmail2snpp sendmail2snpp
	restart sendmail
	edit /etc/aliases to include:
	ALIAS: "|/etc/smrsh/sendmail2snpp PIN@PC"
	run newaliases
