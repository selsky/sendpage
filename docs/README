The TAP protocol specifications appear to be under copyright, so I can't
include the specification with this code.  You'll need to check with the PCIA:
   http://www.pcia.com/wireres/index.htm
or with Motorola:
   http://www.motorola.com/MIMS/MSPG/pcia_protocols/tap_v1p8/index.html


HTML version of TAP v1.8 can be found at
	    http://www.pcia.com/wireres/protocol/tapv1p8/toc.htm
PDF:	    http://www.pcia.com/wireres/protocol/tapv1p8/tap_v1p8.pdf
PostScript: http://www.pcia.com/wireres/protocol/tapv1p8/tap_v1p8.ps

Contact me if you need a copy of the specification and none of the above
URLs work.  I'll help you find a copy.  ;)


I have, however, included the SNPP specifications from RFC1861.

And the "PagingCentrals.txt" file contains a database dump of all the
paging centrals I know about.
