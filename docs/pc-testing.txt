This document is a really rough example of how to examine a paging central to
figure out the paging limits for a particular pager or service.


start with PC configuration defaults.
send a page just to make sure you CAN get a page.

set "esc=true"
Send page with "\n" and "\t"'s (eg "This\nis a CR and this\tis a tab.")

if you see \n and \t okay, you have a real 1.8 TAP, and you're done.
otherwise:
   remove "esc=true"
   set "ctrl=true"
   Send page with "\n" and "\t"'s (eg "This\nis a CR and this\tis a tab.")

   if both \n and \t show up correctly, you have a weak TAP, but you're done.
   if only the \n was displayed correctly, you can pass \n's only, so:
	unset "ctrl=true"
	set "lfok=true"
	and you're done
   otherwise:
	unset "ctrl=true"
	you can't send ctrl chars at all.  sorry!



now, gauge the size of your paging length (test with ctrl/esc/lfok off):

page of 100 chars:

start with X=100 chars
start with SIZE=100 chars

try to send a page:
send a page with SIZE chars
if it xmit fail or go through truncated?
	decrease X by half
	decrease SIZE by X
else
	increase SIZE by X
try page again
	
Some PCs will stall on a "continued.." block, so you may need to force splits
at 250 - pinsize - 2 chars (usually 240).
