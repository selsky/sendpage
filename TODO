Things that we need, organized roughly


Needed For Stable Release
-------------------------
- implement SNPP "HOLD" function
- fully implement SNPP client (fewer modules to load to send a page, no setgid)
- do something so that queues that are waiting on a modem will run
  as soon as the modem is available.  How can I do this when there are
  multiple modems available?  Weird multi semaphore notifications queues
  based on modems?  Gah.  Strange.
- write an email-parsing tool for sending pages from email.
- need better documentation on how to install, set up, test, and run sendpage
- document how to make a "sendpage" user, and find the groups you need
- make sure sendpage.cf gets handled by Makefile.PL  etc dir?
- implement max-blocks-per-session for a PC
- implement email notification fall-back
- email paging failures to page-daemon (Errors-To: ?)
- need documentation on "page-daemon" alias for errors, bounces, warnings, etc?
- implement a better audit log for pages (queued, sent, errors, contents)
  other than just debugging output.
- write POD for snpp tool
- write POD for email2page tool
- implement net/mask checking for SNPP client connections
- does snpp tool need to generate "bounce" emails on bad pages?
- create snpp.conf file for snpp tool to pull its defaults from


Would Be Nice
-------------
- fix all support modules to use a hash list of parameters instead of
  taking a KeesConf object.  This makes things more truely modular.
- code needs more documentation
- write more API documentation for all the modules via pod
- write a data flow graph
- update API doc to reflect changes made for PageQueue, Page, and Recipient
- spit out short GPL note somewhere?
- Write up an example CGI script for sending pages
- Figure out how to do filelocking under Windows
- Figure out what to replace my Syslog calls with under Windows
- add "include" verb to sendpage.cf for sucking in other files?



Stuff I Might Need Some Time Soon
---------------------------------
- implement multiple TAP protocols? (are there differences?  PG1, PG3, etc)
  I don't think I'll ever need this due to my "pc:fields" variable.


I'm Probably Never Going To Implement These Crazy Ideas
-------------------------------------------------------
- if you have A LOT of pages, you'd want multiple modems running for
  a single PC.  Since that would REALLY be a lot of pages, I'm going to
  leave out the idea of parallel tasking modems for the same PC.  That
  seems like insane overkill, but it's something that would be pretty
  cool for HIGH volume paging centers.  Some day, perhaps.
