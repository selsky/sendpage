Things that we need, organized roughly


Needed For Stable Release
-------------------------
*Code
- implement SNPP "HOLD" function
- do something so that queues that are waiting on a modem will run
  as soon as the modem is available.  How can I do this when there are
  multiple modems available?  Weird multi semaphore notifications queues
  based on modems?  Gah.  Strange.
- email paging failures to page-daemon (Errors-To: ?)
- implement net/mask checking for SNPP client connections
- create snpp.conf file for snpp tool to pull its defaults from
- implement more of the API calls with hash opts
- implement character-based translation tables
*Docs
- how to install, set up, test, and run sendpage
- how to make a "sendpage" user & find the groups you need
- how to send pages with email2page
- how to send pages with sendmail
- how "page-daemon" alias for errors, bounces, warnings, etc, works


Would Be Nice
-------------
*Code
- implement max-blocks-per-session for a PC
- implement email notification fall-back
- have all the conf files get handled by Makefile.PL  --  /etc dir?
- fix all support modules to use a hash list of parameters instead of
  taking a KeesConf object.  This makes things more truly modular.
- write up an example CGI script for sending pages
- figure out how to do filelocking under Windows
- figure out what to replace my Syslog calls with under Windows
- add "include" verb to sendpage.cf for sucking in other files?
- spit out short GPL note somewhere?
*Docs
- update API doc to reflect changes made for PageQueue, Page, and Recipient
- more general in-code commenting & documentation
- more API documentation for all the modules via POD
- write a data flow graph



Stuff I Thought Of, But Will Most Likely Never Need
---------------------------------------------------
- implement multiple TAP protocols? (are there differences?  PG1, PG3, etc)
  I don't think I'll ever need this due to the "pc:fields", and "pc:proto"
  variables.


I'm Probably Never Going To Implement These Crazy Ideas
-------------------------------------------------------
- if you have A LOT of pages, you'd want multiple modems running for
  a single PC.  Since that would REALLY be a lot of pages, I'm going to
  leave out the idea of parallel tasking modems for the same PC.  That
  seems like insane overkill, but it's something that would be pretty
  cool for HIGH volume paging centers.  Some day, perhaps.
